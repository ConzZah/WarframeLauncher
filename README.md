## Compatibility:
**Supported Launchers: (3/3)**
- The Standalone Version
- The Steam Version
- The Epic Games Version


## Patch Notes for v0.7:
- defined, that the password in line 3 will now only be copied to clipboard if a game client has been found, where as in previous versions, it was always copied on start regardless. <-- (this is now fixed)
- added a [error help page](https://github.com/ConzZah/WarframeLauncher/blob/main/error_noclientfound.md) to the repo and linked it in the script so anytime no game client is detected it will open automatically after 3 seconds
- licensed the project under the [MIT-License](https://github.com/ConzZah/WarframeLauncher/blob/main/LICENSE)
