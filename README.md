## Patch Notes for v0.6:
- as promised, v0.6 comes with support for the Epic Games version of Warframe.
- script now closes after 10 seconds when done and no longer shows "waiting for x seconds, press a key to continue".
- fixed that LAUNCHING WARFRAME would appear when in fact nothing had been launched yet.
- alot of small improvements.
